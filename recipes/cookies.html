        <p>I made these cookies with my daughter before my husband's birthday. 
            They were out of one of her cookbooks & so good. They had Maple syrup too, along with the peanut butter
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1.5 cups AP flour</li>
            <li>3 tblsp granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 tblsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 cup peanut butter</li>
            <li>1/4 cup maple syrup</li>
            <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
            <li>1 tblsp sugar</li>

<h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>this isn't the actual recipe</li>
            <li>But I wanted to show the lists     </li>
            <li>so, I kinda made this up</li>
            <li>Which is maybe lame, but I keep putting this step off</li>
            <li>and it's time to move on!</li>
        </ol>
