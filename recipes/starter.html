        <p>I first started making my own starter when everyone else did, in March 2020 when
            the world was ending. I came across the method in the tinystarter protocol and followed 
            that since it didn't require a lot of flour. I've sinced moved up to larger volumes of starter
            but still follow roughly the same idea, with a 1:1:1 mix of starter: flour: water
