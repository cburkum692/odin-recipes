        <h1>Starter</h1>

        <img src="../Images/starter.jpg">
       
        <p>I first started making my own starter when everyone else did, in March 2020 when
            the world was ending. I came across the method in the tinystarter protocol and followed 
            that since it didn't require a lot of flour. I've sinced moved up to larger volumes of starter
            but still follow roughly the same idea, with a 1:1:1 mix of starter: flour: water
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup AP flour</li>
            <li>1/4 cup filtered water</li>
            
        </ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>mix water and flour in small jar</li>
            <li>let sit with lid loosely on for 24 hrs</li>
            <li>next day, remove half of mix, and add back same volume of 1:1 flour to water</li>
            <li>after about 4 days should see bubbles from yeast </li>
        </ol>
