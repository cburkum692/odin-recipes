# odin-recipes
This is my first official project for TOP
I will build a site for Recipes and come back to tell you what I did.

My first glitch happened when I didn't add "../" in front of the image on the scones.html file. I had to do this to tell the computer to go back to the parent directory to look for the Images directory, and then find the scones.jpg inside that directory. It was very satisfying to find that issue on the "Links and Images" lesson page again, without having to google a bunch of stuff.

2.11.22 Had some lessons to learn about Git. Not sure what happened, but I ended up with a copy of odin-recipes inside of recipes folder. I feel like I cheated figuring it out, because I went and looked at the GUI "windows" to see the folder was in two places. But, after I removed it, and then removed it using "git rm odin-recipes", I was able to add, commit, and push the starter.html file. So. Yay?

2.12.22 Ok, so things went a little smoother. I added the links & pictures to the other two recipes. And created a file for the cookies recipe. I am still getting a little hung up in Git... it keeps telling me that a new branch has been made and then I have to merge them. I think I might be starting off the wrong way when I open everything. Maybe I need to do a "git configure ..." something or an other every time I get started? Then after I do the git add, git commit -m, and git push, I still have to sync pressing the branch icon on the VS code window. Maybe that's where I am going wrong? Or am I supposed to "git pull " first? Yeah, so the html part is going fine, but the using git part is slowing me down. 

2.25.22 Way longer than I wanted to go between practices. I did the git steps the right way today! Added ordered & unordered lists to recipes. Now need to look at them and then I am on to CSS section. YAY!

3.16.22 I had added more notes to this yesterday or the day before, but apparently didn't save them. Today's successes: added <p> elements to the index file to get the images to stack on top of each other. I'd still like the links under the images, but haven't figured that out yet. Played around with the borders on images. Added a font difference to the links. Got in, got out just fine with git, using the links in visual studio code. Maybe that makes sense for now. Need to make a daily routing for coding, at least 30 - 45 minutes a day.
