# odin-recipes
This is my first official project for TOP
I will build a site for Recipes and come back to tell you what I did.

My first glitch happened when I didn't add "../" in front of the image on the scones.html file. I had to do this to tell the computer to go back to the parent directory to look for the Images directory, and then find the scones.jpg inside that directory. It was very satisfying to find that issue on the "Links and Images" lesson page again, without having to google a bunch of stuff.

2.11.22 Had some lessons to learn about Git. Not sure what happened, but I ended up with a copy of odin-recipes inside of recipes folder. I feel like I cheated figuring it out, because I went and looked at the GUI "windows" to see the folder was in two places. But, after I removed it, and then removed it using "git rm odin-recipes", I was able to add, commit, and push the starter.html file. So. Yay?
